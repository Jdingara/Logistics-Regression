## **Logistic Regression: Rock vs Mine Prediction using Sonar Data**

### **Project Overview**
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a sonar signal is identifying a rock or a mine. By using a logistic regression approach, the project achieved an accuracy of 80% in classifying objects based on sonar data.

### **Objective**
- Develop a predictive model that can classify sonar signals as rocks or mines using logistic regression.

---

### **Dataset Information**
- **Data Source**: The sonar dataset consists of 208 samples, each with 60 frequency-based attributes. The labels are binary—rock or mine.
- **Features**: 60 attributes per sample, each representing a frequency response from sonar signals.
- **Target**: Classifies objects as **rock (R)** or **mine (M)**.

### **Tools and Libraries Used**
1. **Google Collaboratory**: Used for coding and running the entire analysis.
2. **Pandas**: Utilized for loading, manipulating, and exploring the dataset.
3. **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning tasks, including:
   - Logistic regression modeling.
   - Data splitting (training and testing).
   - Performance evaluation.

---

### **Methodology**

#### 1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.
   - Basic exploration was done using `.describe()` to understand key statistics like mean, standard deviation, and distribution of each feature.
   
   **Example Code**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv('sonar.all-data.csv', header=None)
   print(data.describe())
   ```

#### 2. **Data Splitting**
   - The dataset was divided into a **training set** (for model learning) and a **test set** (for model evaluation). The typical ratio used was 75% training and 25% testing.
   
   **Example Code**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   X = data.iloc[:, :-1]
   y = data.iloc[:, -1].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'M' else 0)  # Converting labels to binary (Mine=1, Rock=0)
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
   ```

#### 3. **Model Implementation**
   - A **logistic regression** model was chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness in handling binary classification problems.
   - The model was trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data.
   
   **Example Code**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
   
   model = LogisticRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
   print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
   ```

#### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Accuracy** was the primary performance metric used to evaluate the model. After training and testing, the model achieved an accuracy of **80%** in predicting rocks vs. mines.
   
   **Further Evaluation**:
   - Other evaluation metrics like confusion matrix and precision/recall can also be computed to get a clearer understanding of the model’s performance.

### **Questions & Answers**

**Q1. Why was logistic regression chosen for this problem?**  
**A1**: Logistic regression is a widely used algorithm for binary classification problems like rock vs mine. It’s simple, interpretable, and effective for this kind of task, especially when dealing with linearly separable data.

**Q2. How was the dataset split?**  
**A2**: The dataset was split into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets to ensure that the model could generalize well to new, unseen data.

**Q3. How was the model evaluated?**  
**A3**: The model’s performance was evaluated using **accuracy** as the main metric, achieving 80%. Further tuning and use of advanced techniques could improve results.

**Q4. Could the model be improved?**  
**A4**: Yes, potential improvements could come from:
   - **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from the existing data.
   - **Other Algorithms**: Exploring other classification models like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks.
   - **Parameter Tuning**: Using Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters for logistic regression.

### **Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrated the ability to classify sonar signals as rocks or mines using a logistic regression model. The model achieved an accuracy of 80%, showing the potential of sonar data for predictive classification. Future work could include testing other machine learning algorithms and fine-tuning the logistic regression model to improve accuracy.

### **Future Improvements**
- Explore **feature scaling** to normalize data, which could improve logistic regression performance.
- Use techniques like **cross-validation** to ensure the model is robust and not overfitting to the training data.
- Implement more complex models for comparison.
